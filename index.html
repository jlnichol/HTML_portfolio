 <h2 id="nontitle">About</h2>
 <p>I am a Senior at Brigham Young University, and this April I will graduate with a degree in English Language, along with minors in editing and computer science.
 Following graduation, I would like to find work as a technical writer or editor. My computer science classes have taught me useful technical skills to prepare for such positions. 
 This portfolio is meant to display some of those skills and demonstrate that I have some ability to implement basic web programming.</p>

 <p>From September 2017 to May 2018, I worked as a computer science teaching assistant at BYU and as a volunteer acquisitions editor for the BYU <em>Leading Edge</em> magazine. I also did some freelance editing work
 in early 2018, primarily doing source checking. </p>
